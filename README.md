The program is very simple. 

Just write this:
./sorthis selection/bubble/merge

Make sure to write in all small caps.

To keep it simple, if you want to change the numbers in the array, you need to change them manually in the code.
If you want to add more sorting methods, feel free to add their functions but don't forget to change the number of ways you can sort the array.

HAVE FUN!!!
